#problem
Prove that every finite group of order greater than 2 has a nontrivial automorphism.

#proof

::ProblemBlock{number=2}
#problem
In this problem there is no need to justify your answers.

(a) Define __UFD__.

(b) Define __PID__.

(c) For the properties "UFD" and "PID", give an example of a commutative integral domain that

i. satisfies both properties

ii. satisfies one property but not the other

iii. satisfies neither property

#proof

::ProblemBlock{number=3}
#problem
(a) Prove that $\Q(\sqrt[4]{T})$ is not Galois over $\Q(T)$, where $T$ is an indeterminate.

(b) Find the Galois closure of $\Q(\sqrt[4]{T})$ over $\Q(T)$ and determine the Galois group both as an abstract group and as a set of explicit automorphisms. (Fully justify.)

::ProblemBlock{number=4}
#problem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with multiplicative identity. An element $r\in R$ is called __nilpotent__ if there exists a postive integer $n$ such that $r^n=0$.

(a) Prove that every nilpotent element lies in every prime ideal.

(b) Assume that every element of $R$ is either nilpotent or a unit. Prove that $R$ has a unique prime ideal.

::ProblemBlock{number=5}
#problem
For every positive integer $n$, denote by $C_n$ a cyclic group of order $n$ and by $D_n$ a dihedral group of order $2n$, so that
$$
D_n = \{1,a,a^2,\ldots,a^{n-1},b,ba,ba^2,\ldots,ba^{n-1}\}
$$
where $a$ has order $n$, $b$ has order 2 and $ab=ba^{-1}$.

(a) In the notation explained above, prove that every subgroup of $\langle a\rangle$ is normal in $D_n$.

(b) If $n=2m$ with $m$ odd, prove that $D_n = D_{2m} \cong C_2 \times D_m$.

(c) Is $D_{12}\cong C_3\times D_4$? Justify your answer.
