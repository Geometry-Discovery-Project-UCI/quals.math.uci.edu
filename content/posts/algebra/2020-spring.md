::ProblemBlock{number=1}
#problem
Consdier the cube $C$ in the Euclidean vector space $\R^3$ as the set of points $(x,y,z)$ for which the absolute value of each of the coordinates is less than or equal to 1. Let $G$ be the group of those rotations in $\R^3$ preserving the origin which send $C$ to itself. Show that $G$ is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_4$.

#problem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1. Recall that an element $r$ of $R$ is idempotent if $r^2=r$. Assume $R$ is finite and strictly more that $\frac23$ elements of $R$ are idempotent. Let $A$ be the set of all idempotent elements of $R$ and $Z=A\cap(A-1)$.

(a) Prove that $2a=0$ whenever $a\in Z$.

(b) Prove that $(Z,+)$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$ of index at most 2.

(c) Prove that $(A,+)$ is a subgroup of $(R,+)$ and conclude that every element of $R$ is idempotent.

::ProblemBlock{number=6}
#problem
We say that a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ is __invertible__ iff there exists a finitely generated $R$-module $N$ such that $M\otimes_R N\cong R$.

(a) Find all invertible $\Z$-modules.

(b) Prove that if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are both invertible then so is $M_1\otimes_R M_2$.

(c) Prove that every invertible $R$-module is projective.

Let $f(x)\in \Q[x]$ be a monic cubic polynomial with distinct roots $r,s,t$. Let $g(x)$ be the monic cubic polynomial with roots $r^2+s+t$, $s^2+t+r$, and $t^2+r+s$.
