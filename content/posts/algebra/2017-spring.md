#proof

::ProblemBlock{number=2}
#problem
Prove that the additive group $\R/\Z$ is isomorphic to the multiplicative group $\{ z\in \C : |z|=1\}$.

#proof

::ProblemBlock{number=3}
#problem
Let $R$ be an integral domain. A nonzero nonunit element $p\in R$ is __prime__ if $p|ab$ implies that $p|a$ or $p|b$. A nonzero nonunit $p\in R$ is __irreducible__ if $p=ab$ implies that $a$ or $b$ is a unit.

(a) Show that every prime element is irreducible.

(b) Show that if $R$ is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), then every irreducible element is prime.

::ProblemBlock{number=6}
#problem
Let $R$ be a commutative ring with 1, and let $M$ be an $R$-module. Show that if $M\oplus M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module, then $M$ is a finitely generated $R$-module.

::ProblemBlock{number=7}
#problem
(a) Find a polynomial $f(x)\in \Q[x]$ whose splitting field $L_f$ has Galois group $Gal(L_f/\Q)$ isomorphic to $\Z/2\Z$.

(b) Find a polynomial $g(x)\in \Q[x]$ whose splitting field $L_g$ has Galois group $Gal(L_g/\Q)$ isomorphic to $S_3$.

::ProblemBlock{number=8}
#problem
Suppose $F$ is a perfect field and $f(x)\in F[x]$ is a nonconstant polynomial. Show that $F[x]//(f(x))$ is a direct product of fields if and only if $f(x)$ is a separable polynomial.

__Note:__ A previous version of this problem incorrectly left out the assumption that $F$ is perfect.

::ProblemBlock{number=9}
#problem
Suppose $p$ is a prime.

(a) Show that all matrices $A\in GL_2(\F_p)$ of order exactly $p$ have the same characteristic polynomial, and find that polynomial.

(b) Show that all matrices $A\in GL_2(\F_p)$ of order exactly $p$ have the same minimal polynomial, and find that polynomial.

::ProblemBlock{number=10}
#problem
Let $K=\F_3(\sqrt{2})$ and let $f(x)=x^4+1\in \F_3[x]$.

(a) Show that $K$ is the splitting field of $f$.

(b) Find a generator $\alpha$ of the multiplicative group $K^\times$.
