Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity $1\neq 0$. A module $N$ over a ring $R$ is __simple__ if it is nonzero and it has no proper nonzero submodules. Prove that an $R$-module $N$ is simple if and only if $N\cong R/M$ for a maximal ideal $M$ of $R$.

#problem
Consider a finite extension of fields $K/F$. Prove that the following are equivalent:

(i) $K$ is a splitting field of some polynomial in $F[x]$ over $F$.

(ii) Every irreducible polynomial $p(x)\in F[x]$ which has a root in $K$ splits in $K[x]$ into linear factors.

#problem
Recall that $\Z$ is the ring of integers, $\R$ is the ring of real numbers, and $\C$ is the ring of complex numbers. Also $i=\sqrt{-1}$ and $\Z[i]$ is the ring of Gaussian integers.

Prove that $\Z[i]\otimes_\Z \R$ and $\C$ are isomorphic as rings.

Recall that if $S,S'$ are rings extending a ring $R$ then on $S\otimes_R S'$ the ring multiplication is defined by letting $(s\otimes t)(s'\otimes t')=ss'\otimes tt'$ for all simple tensors.
