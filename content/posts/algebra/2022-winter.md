Assume $H$ is a normal subgroup of a group $G$. Let $S$ denote the set of left cosets of $H$ in $G$. Prove that the following operation is well-defined:
$$
S\times S\to S, \qquad (aH,bH)\mapsto abH.
$$

Let $n\geq 5$ be an integer. You may use without proof that $A_n$ is the only non-trivial proper normal subgroup of $S_n$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $S_n$ such that $1<[S_n:H]<n$. Prove that $H=A_n$.

Prove that if $G$ is a group of order 12, then $G$ is isomorphic to a semidirect product $H\rtimes_\varphi K$ where $H,K\leq G$ are proper non-trivial subgroups of $G$.

Assume $M$ is an $n\times n$ matrix over some field $F$, and assume $\vec{v}\in F^n$ is a vector such that $(M-\lambda I)\vec{v}\neq \vec{0}$ and $(M-\lambda I)^2\vec{v}=\vec{0}$ for some $\lambda\in F$, where $I$ denotes the $n\times n$ identity matrix. Prove that $M$ is not diagonalizable.

#problem
Let $R$ be a ring and assume $I$ is a prime ideal in $R$. Assume $R/I$ satisfies the __descending chain condition__, meaning that for every countably infinite  descending chain $J_1\supseteq J_2\supseteq\cdots$ in $R/I$, there exists $N>0$ such that $J_n=J_{n+1}$ for all integers $n\geq N$. Prove that $I$ is a maximal ideal in $R$.

Consider the subring $S$ of $\Q[x]$ defined as follows: $S=\{ f(x)\in\Q[x] : f(0)\in\Z \}$. Prove that the element $x\in S$ cannot be expressed as a product of irreducible elements.

::ProblemBlock{number=8}
#problem
Let $n\geq 2$ be an integer, and let $\zeta_n$ denote a primitive $n$-th root of unity.

(a) Give an explicit bijection between $Gal(\Q(\zeta_n)/\Q)$ and $(\Z/n\Z)^\times$. You don't have to prove it's a bijection.

(b) What is the degree of $\Q(\zeta_{11}+\zeta_{11}^3+\zeta_{11}^9 + \zeta_{11}^5 + \zeta_{11}^4)/\Q$? Justify your answer.

#problem
For each of the following, eithe give an example or briefly explain why no such example exists.

(a) Finite order elements $a,b$ in a group $G$ such that $ab$ has infinite order.

(b) A surjective group homomorphism $\Q\to\Z$.

(c) A $3\times 3$ real matrix $M$ such that $M^2=-I_3$, where $I_3$ is the $3\times 3$ identity matrix.

(d) A tower of fields $K\supseteq E\supseteq F$ such that $K/E$ and $E/F$ are Galois extensions but $K/F$ is not a Galois extension.
