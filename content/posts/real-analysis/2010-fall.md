#problem
Consider a measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ and a sequence of measurable sets $E_n$, $n\in\N$, such that $\sum_n \mu(E_n)<\infty$. Shw that almost every $x\in X$ is an element of at most finitely many $E_n$.

::ProblemBlock{number=2}
#problem
Consider a measure space $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ with $\mu(X)<\infty$, and a sequence $f_n:X\to\R$ of measurable functions such that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x)=f(x)$ for all $x\in X$. Show that for every $\eps>0$ there exists a set $E$ of measure $\mu(E)\leq \eps$ such that $(f_n)$ converges uniformly to $f$ outside the set $E$.

Suppose that $f\in L^p([0,1])$ for some $p>2$. Prove that $g(x) = f(x^2)\in L^1([0,1])$.

#problem
Assume $E\subset [0,1]$ is measurable and for any $(a,b)\subset [0,1]$,

#problem
Let $f$ be a real-valued uniformly continuous function on $[0,\infty)$. Show that if $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $[0,\infty)$, then $\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=0$.

#problem
Consider the Lebesgue measure space $(\R,\mathfrak{M}_L,\mu_L)$ on $\R$. Let $f$ be an extended real-valued $\mathfrak{M}_L$-measurable function on $\R$. For $x\in \R$ and $r>0$ let $B_r(x) = \{r\in\R : |y-x|<r \}$.

With $r>0$ fixed, define a function $g$ on $\R$ by setting
$$
g(x) = \int_{B_r(x)} f(y)\, \mu_L(dy) \quad \text{ for } c\in\R.
$$

(a) Suppose $f$ is locally $\mu_L$-integrable on $\R$, that is, $f$ is $\mu_L$-integrable on every bounded $\mathfrak{M}_L$-measurable set in $\R$. Show that $g$ is a real-valued continuous function on $\R$.

(b) Show that if $f$ is $\mu_L$-integrable on $\R$ then $g$ is uniformly continuous on $\R$.
