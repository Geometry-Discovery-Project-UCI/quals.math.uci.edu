#problem
For $m\geq 1$, denote
$$
\{ q_m\}_{m\geq 1}
$$
as the set of rational numbers in $[0,1]$. Denote
$$
f_m(x) = |x-q_m|^{-\frac34} \quad \text{for } x\in [0,1]
$$
Prove that there exists a sequence of positive numbers $\{a_m\}_{m\geq 1}$ such that
$$
\sum_{m=1}^\infty a_mf_m(x) \quad \text{converges for a.e. } x\in[0,1]
$$

$f_n$ is a sequence of measurable functions on $[0,1]$. Prove that
$$
\lim_{n\to+\infty} \int_{[0,1]} \frac{f_n}{1+|f_n|}\, dx = 0
$$
if and only if $f_n$ converges to 0 in measure.

#problem
Let $(X,\mathcal{M},\mu)$ be a measure space. Let $g$ be a real-valued $\mathcal{M}$-measurable function on $X$. Suppose $fg$ is $\mu$-integrable on $X$ for every $\mu$-integrable real-valued $\mathcal{M}$-measurable function $f$ on $X$. Show that $||g||_\infty<\infty$.

::ProblemBlock{number=4}
#problem
Let $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ be a measure space. Consider an $\mathcal{A}$-measurable function $f$ on $X$ such that $||f||_p<\infty$ for some $p\in(0,\infty)$. Show that 
$$
\lim_{N\to\infty} N^p\mu\{|f|\geq N\} = 0
$$

::ProblemBlock{number=5}
#problem
A metric $d$ on a space $X$ is called an \emph{ultrametric} if the triangle inequality is replaced by the following stronger property. For all $x,y,z\in X$:
$$
d(x,z)\leq \max(d(x,y),d(y,z))
$$
Prove:

1. If $B$ is an open ball in $X$, then any point in $B$ is a center of $B$. (This means that for all $x\in B$, $B=B(x,r)$ for some $r$.)

2. Every open ball in $X$ is both open and closed.

Compute
$$
\lim_{n\to\infty} \int_0^1 \sin(nx)e^{-x^2}\, dx

Be sure to justify your answer. (You may assume elementary facts about calculus, but state them.)
